# calculator
Calculator assignment, for The Odin Project.

Currently in development.

Use cases:
    - Perform simple mathematical operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
    - The calculator does not evaluate more than a single pair of numbers at a time
    - This means the calculator does not follow priority of operations. For example, 
      12 + 7 - 5 * 3 = will yield 42, rather than 4.
    - Answers are rounded to just a few decimal places to avoid display overflow
